# clustering_countries_by_development

Basic analysis of a dataset acquired in kaggle using R for clustering and Tableau for visualization

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data

The main goals in this analysis are:

Group countries to try to identify patterns of similarity between the regions of the world

Try to demonstrate how the geographic location may or may not influence the development of a country

The analysis vizualization its on my Tableau public profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gabriel.conte/viz/clustering_countries_by_development/Painel1
